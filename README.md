Tower Defense Ball-Stopper is an exciting and challenging Unity game that puts your strategic skills to the test! Get ready to defend the finish line against a relentless onslaught of rolling balls. Your goal is to build and strategically place towers to stop the balls from reaching the finish line. Every ball that is successfully destroyed by your towers adds to your score.

**Key Features:**
🔷 Tower Defense Gameplay: Experience classic tower defense mechanics with a unique twist. Instead of enemies walking, you'll be dealing with rolling balls that must be stopped in their tracks!

🔷 Diverse Tower Types: Choose from a variety of towers, each with its own set of abilities and strengths. Make tactical decisions on which towers to use for the most effective defense.

🔷 Tower Placement and Selling: Take control of your strategy by selecting and placing towers at strategic points on the map. Don't worry if you change your mind; you can also sell towers by clicking on them to recoup resources for better placements.
